  <!-- About Section -->
  <h3>Animator/Illustrator</h3>

  <p>As an artist, my work is driven by a deep commitment to representation, inclusivity, and the celebration of Black history and culture. With over six years of experience in the field of animation, I have always been inspired by the transformative power of storytelling—particularly the ability to shape how children of color see themselves in the world. Throughout my creative journey, I’ve sought to create spaces where young audiences can feel seen, valued, and empowered by the stories they encounter.</p>

  <p>After graduation, my goal is to work within the animation/ illustration industry, where I can help shape projects that prioritize inclusivity and reflect the diverse experiences of today’s youth. I am passionate about the role of animation in fostering understanding, empathy, and positive change, and I aspire to create narratives that inspire, educate, and celebrate the stories of those who have often been overlooked.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, my work is a testament to my belief that every child, regardless of background, deserves to see themselves reflected in the art they engage with. As I continue to grow as an artist, I remain committed to amplifying voices, cultures, and stories that deserve to be heard and celebrated.</p>

  <h3>Who is the "Cookie Lady"?</h3>

  <p>"Cookie Lady Cartoons" comes from my grandmother, affectionately known as the "Cookie Lady" in our family. She has always been my biggest supporter, nurturing my creativity from a young age. Simultaneously baking cookies and encouraging my artistic pursuits, she has always been there for me. The name honors her loving spirit and her vital role in inspiring my art, serving as a tribute to her unwavering support throughout my career. I love you Mama Jean <3.</p>
